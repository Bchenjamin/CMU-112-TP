Welcome to 2D Runner!

2D Runner is essentially a 2D platformer game with the main feature of the game being an auto sidescroller that threatens to catch up with the
player. In order to progress through the game, the player must maneuver the character through a series of platforms all while collecting many powerups
and coins along the way. Each coin collected will contribute to the player totalâ€™s score which will be shown at the top the screen. The game is designed 
to be a 2D infinite runner, meaning that the game only ends when the screen catches up to the player. To ensure this, the screen over time will move faster
and faster, making jumps harder. Assessment of performance will solely be decided on the score the player has attained at the end of his or her run.


Running the Program
First, extract all the files in the zip file into a separate folder. After this, go into GAME.PY and run the code. Simple!

There are no additional libraries that need to be installed. All you need is cmu112_graphics and that's it :)

Please use the mouse to select the difficulty you want and the arrows keys to move. The down arrow key does nothing while the up arrow key makes the
character jump. You can move the character left and right using the respective arrow keys (the game has been programmed to make walking backwards a lot
slower than walking forwards).

GOOD LUCK! ENJOY THE GAME!!!
